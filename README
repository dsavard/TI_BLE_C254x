Serial python package required!
pyserial -> python-serial in ubuntu

1. ls /dev
2. look for ttyACMX
3. write it into bluetooth.py
4. start with  "python bluetooth.py"
5. type d for discovery
6. type e for establishing the link
7. type 1 for activating all notifications
8. enjoy and type t for terminating the link

2 deactivates the notifications, however t do this
as well. Option 2 is somewhat redundant.

Problems:

If /dev/ttyACMx is not created when pluging the dongle,
check your kernel to find out if the required module
was compiled.

CONFIG_USB_ACM=true  module: cdc-acm
